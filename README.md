## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to gain a understanding of string processing in C. To make my own implementation key functions from the `libc`, introducing C# string methods into C, exploring tokenization, and determine how other data types are converted into strings, enhance proficiency in handling strings, solidify structured programming skills and unit testing functions for improvement.

## Key Achievements

- **String Handling in C**: Enhanced proficiency in C string manipulation.
- **Custom C# Functions in C**: Developed and implemented C#-inspired string functions that aren't natively available in C.
- **Static Libraries & Makefile**: Gained expertise in building and linking static libraries and automating builds with Makefile.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Embraced TDD methodology, using unit tests for instant feedback during development and refactoring.
- **Unit Testing & Coverage**: Utilized the Check framework for unit testing and gcov for analyzing test coverage.

## Insights & Challenges

- **Cross-Platform Issues**: Addressed differences in code behavior across operating systems, with campus machines offering the best testing environment.
- **Precision with `sprintf`**: Navigated challenges related to precision, the `#` flag, and wide characters in the `sprintf` function.

## Usage
1. clone this repository
2. `cd s21_string.h/src/`
3. run `make all` to build project
4. run `make test` to run tests
5. run `make s21_string.a` to build a static lab
